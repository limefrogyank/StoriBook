    <h2>What is an Earthquake?</h2>
    <h3>Earthquake Shaking Comes from Elastic Deformation</h3>
    <p>Earthquakes occur when rock <strong>ruptures</strong>(breaks), causing rocks on one side of a fault to move
        relative to the rocks on the other side. Although motion along a fault is part of what happens when an
        earthquake occurs, rocks grinding past each other is not what creates the shaking. In fact, it could be said
        that the earthquake happens <em>after </em>rocks have undergone most of the displacement. Consider this: if
        rocks slide a few centimeters or even meters along a fault, would that motion <em>alone </em>explain the
        incredible damage caused by some earthquakes? If you were in a car that suddenly accelerated then stopped, you
        would feel a jolt. But earthquakes are not a single jolt. Buildings can swing back and forth until they shake
        themselves to pieces, train tracks can buckle and twist into s-shapes, and roads can roll up and down like waves
        on the ocean. During an earthquake, rock is not only slipping. It is also vibrating like a plucked guitar
        string.</p>
    <p>Rocks might seem rigid, but when stress is applied they may stretch. If there hasn’t been too much stretching, a
        rock will snap back to its original shape once the stress is removed. Deformation that is reversible is called
        <strong>elastic deformation</strong>. Rocks that are stressed beyond their ability to stretch can rupture,
        allowing the rest of the rock to snap back to its original shape. The snapping back of the rock returning to its
        original shape causes the rock to vibrate, and this is what causes the shaking during an earthquake. The
        snapping back is called <strong>elastic rebound</strong>.</p>
    <p>Figure 4A.9 (top) shows this sequence of events. Stress is applied to rock and deforms it. The deformed rock
        ruptures, forming a fault. After rupturing, the rock above and below the fault snaps back to the shape it had
        before deformation.</p>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure 4A.9 </strong>Elastic deformation, rupture, and elastic rebound. Top: Stress applied
            to a rock causes it to deform by stretching. When the stress becomes too much for the rock, it ruptures,
            forming a fault. The rock snaps back to its original shape in a process called elastic rebound. Bottom: On
            an existing fault, asperities keep rocks on either side of the fault from sliding. Stress deforms the rock
            until the asperities break, releasing the stress, and causing the rocks to spring back to their original
            shape. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY 4.0. Modified after Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0</em>

    <p>Ruptures can also occur along pre-existing faults (Figure 4A.9, bottom). The rocks on either side of the fault
        are locked together because bumps along the fault, called <strong>asperities</strong>, prevent the rocks from
        moving relative to each other. When the stress is great enough to break the asperities, the rocks on either side
        of the fault can slide again. While the rocks are locked together, stress can cause elastic deformation. When
        asperities break and release the stress, the rocks undergo elastic rebound and return to their original shape.
    </p>
    <h3>Rupture Surfaces Are Where the Action Happens</h3>
    <p>Images like the one above are useful for illustrating elastic deformation and rupture, but they can be
        misleading. The rupture that happens doesn’t occur as in 4A.9, with the block being ruptured through and
        through. The rupture and displacement only happen along a subsection of a fault, called the <strong>rupture
            surface</strong>. In Figure 4A.10 below, the rupture surface is the dark pink patch. It takes up only a part
        of the <strong>fault plane</strong>(lighter pink). The fault plane represents the surface where the fault
        exists, and where ruptures have happened in the past. Although the fault plane is drawn as being flat in Figure
        4A.10, faults are not actually perfectly flat.</p>
    <p>The location on the fault plane where the rupture happens is called the <b>hypocentre or</b>&nbsp;<b>focus of</b>
        the earthquake (Figure 4A.10, right). The location on Earth’s surface immediately above the hypocentre is the
        <b>epicenter of</b>&nbsp;the earthquake.</p>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure 4A.10 </strong>Rupture surface (dark pink), on a fault plane (light pink). The
            diagram represents a part of the crust that may be tens or hundreds of kilometers long. The rupture surface
            is the part of the fault plane along which displacement occurred. Left: In this example, the near side of
            the fault is moving to the left, and the lengths of the arrows within the rupture surface represent relative
            amounts of displacement. Colored arrows represent the propagation of failure on a rupture surface. In this
            case, the failure starts at the dark blue heavy arrow and propagates outward, reaching the left side first
            (green arrows) and the right side last (yellow arrows). Right: An earthquake’s location can be described in
            terms of its hypocentre (or focus), the location on the fault plane where the rupture happens, or in terms
            of its epicenter (red star), the location above the hypocentre. <em>Source: Left: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY

    </figure>
    <p>Within the rupture surface, the amount of displacement varies. In Figure 4A.10, the larger arrows indicate where
        there has been more displacement and the smaller arrows where there has been less. Beyond the edge of the
        rupture surface, there is no displacement at all. Notice that this particular rupture surface doesn’t even
        extend to the land surface of the diagram.</p>
    <p>The size of a rupture surface and the amount of displacement along it will depend on a number of factors,
        including the type and strength of the rock, and the degree to which the rock was stressed beforehand. The
        magnitude of an earthquake will depend on the size of the rupture surface and the amount of displacement.</p>
    <p>A rupture doesn’t occur all at once along a rupture surface. It starts at a single point and spreads rapidly from
        there. Figure 4A.10 illustrates a case where rupturing starts at the heavy blue arrow in the middle, then
        continues through the light blue arrows. The rupture spreads to the left side (green arrows), then to the right
        (yellow arrows).</p>
    <p>Depending on the extent of the rupture surface, the propagation of <strong>failures</strong>(incremental ruptures
        contributing to making the final rupture surface) from the point of initiation is typically completed within
        seconds to several tens of seconds. The initiation point isn’t necessarily in the center of the rupture surface;
        it may be close to one end, near the top, or near the bottom.</p>
    <h3>Shifting Stress Causes Foreshocks and Aftershocks</h3>
    <p>Earthquakes don’t usually occur in isolation. There is often a sequence in which smaller earthquakes occur prior
        to a larger one, and then progressively smaller earthquakes occur after. The largest earthquake in the series is
        the <strong>mainshock</strong>. The smaller ones that come before are <strong>foreshocks</strong>, and the
        smaller ones that come after are <strong>aftershocks</strong>. These descriptions are relative, so it can be
        necessary to reclassify an earthquake. For example, the strongest earthquake in a series is classified as the
        mainshock, but if another even bigger one comes after it, the bigger one is called the mainshock, and the
        earlier one is reclassified as an aftershock.</p>
    <p>A rupture surface does not fail all at once. A rupture in one place leads to another, which leads to another.
        Aftershocks and foreshocks represent the same thing, except on a much larger scale. The rupture illustrated in
        Figure 4A.10 reduced stress in one area, but in doing so, transferred stress to others (Figure 4A.11). Imagine a
        frayed rope breaking strand by strand. When a strand breaks, the tension on that strand is released, but the
        remaining strands must still hold up the same amount of weight. If another strand breaks under the increased
        burden, the remaining strands have an even greater burden than before. In the same way that the stress causes
        one strand after another to fail, a rupture can trigger subsequent ruptures nearby.</p>

    <p>Numerous aftershocks were associated with the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Haida Gwaii in October of 2012
        (Figure 4A.12; mainshock in red, aftershocks in white). Some of the stress released by the mainshock was
        transferred to other nearby parts of the fault and contributed to a cascade of smaller ruptures. But stress
        transfer need not be restricted to the fault along which an earthquake happened. It will affect the rocks in
        general around the site of the earthquake and may lead to increased stress on other faults in the region. The
        aftershocks from the Haida Gwaii earthquake are scattered rather than located only on the main faults.</p>

    <p>The effects of stress transfer may not show immediately. Aftershocks can be delayed for hours, days, weeks, or
        even years. Because stress transfer affects a region, not just a single fault, and because there can be delays
        between the event that transferred stress and the one that was triggered by the transfer, it can sometimes be
        hard to know whether one earthquake is actually associated with another and whether a foreshock or aftershock
        should be assigned to a particular mainshock.</p>
    <h3>Episodic Tremor and Slip</h3>
    <p><strong>Episodic tremor and slip</strong>(ETS) is periodic slow sliding along part of a subduction boundary. It
        does not produce recognizable earthquakes but does produce seismic tremors (observed as rapid seismic vibrations
        on instruments). It was first discovered on the Vancouver Island part of the Cascadia subduction zone by
        Geological Survey of Canada geologists Herb Dragert and Gary Rogers.</p>
    <p>The boundary between the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate and the North America Plate can be divided into three
        segments (Figure 4A.13). The cold upper part of the boundary is the <strong>locked zone</strong>. There the
        plates are stuck together for long periods of time. When slip does occur, it generates very large earthquakes.
        The last time the locked zone along Canada’s west coast slipped was January 26, 1700. It caused an earthquake of
        magnitude 9. The warm lower part of the boundary, called the <strong>continuous slip zone</strong>, is sliding
        continuously because the warm rock is weaker. The central part of the boundary, the <strong>ETS zone</strong>,
        isn’t cold enough to be stuck but isn’t warm enough to slide continuously. Instead, it slips episodically
        approximately every 14 months for about 2 weeks, moving a few centimeters each time.</p>

            slipping continuously. In the intermediate (ETS) zone, the plate alternately sticks and slips on a regular
            schedule. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It might seem that periodic slip along this part of the plate helps to reduce tension, and thus reduce the risk
        of a large earthquake. In fact, the opposite is likely the case. The movement along the ETS part of the plate
        boundary transfers stress to the adjacent locked part of the plate. During the two-week ETS period, the transfer
        of stress means an increased chance of a large earthquake.</p>
    <p>Since 2003, ETS processes have also been observed in subduction zones in Mexico and Japan.</p>
