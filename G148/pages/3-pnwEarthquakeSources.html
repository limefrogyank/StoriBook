    <h2>PNW Earthquake Sources</h2>
    <p>Seismologists categorize Cascadia region earthquakes into 4 different types, depending on where they occur,
        (their "source zones"). Three types in particular, Cascadia Megathrust, Deep Intraplate, and Crustal Faulting
        earthquakes,&nbsp;may occasionally produce strong shaking that can threaten life and property. The fourth type,
        volcanic earthquakes, are generally too small and remote to cause damage directly, but they provide strong clues
        about potential volcanic eruptions.</p>
    <p>While only one type (Cascadia Megathrust) actually ruptures a plate boundary, all of these earthquakes can be
        understood to result from <a href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/about-earthquakes/plate-tectonics" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Plate Tectonics</a>.</p>
    <p>In Cascadia, strain arises from the interaction of three tectonic plates. North American, Juan de Fuca, and
        (indirectly) the Pacific Plate all are moving with different trajectories. Offshore from British Columbia,
        Washington, Oregon, and N. California, a young oceanic plate called the Juan de Fuca Plate is spreading away
        from the Pacific Plate and plunging beneath North America. [You might think of building a salami sandwich by
        holding 2 slices of bread together, and shoving the salami in from the side -- not very efficient, and you're
        likely to get Mayo everywhere!]. Temporarily locked together (since the great Cascadia Subduction Zone
        Earthquake of 1700), strain is building in the locked interface between these two plates that will be released
        in future earthquakes. Read more about the <a href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/earthquakesources/csz"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cascadia Subduction Zone</a><strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>The crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate, which consists of basalt and marine sediments, is itself placed under strain
        as it is forced beneath North America and down into the Earth's mantle. The slab is bent and pulled by gravity.
        In a zone from near the coastline to the foothills of the Cascades but centered on the Puget Lowland, breaks in
        this subducting slab produce Deep Intraplate earthquakes. Most of the damaging historic earthquakes in
        Washington State were from this <a href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/earthquakesources/deepearthquakes"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep earthquake source</a><strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>Shallow or Crustal Earthquakes occur on faults in the North American Plate. Some are so shallow that they can
        break or deform the ground surface. Others can occur up to 35 Km deep and may not be associated with faults
        observed at the surface. Strain from the Cascadia Subduction Zone plays a role in some crustal earthquakes in
        Western Washington and Oregon but the shearing of California as the Pacific Plate grinds along the western edge
        of the North American Plate to the south plays a bigger role in the generation of <a
            href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/earthquakesources/crustalfaults" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crustal
            earthquakes</a><strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>Volcanic earthquakes are triggered by changes in the magmatic system within and beneath the volcano. When magma
        is injected or removed from the system, surrounding rock will either shift to make room for the injected magma
        or fill in a vacated area. These actions are the cause of <a

            earthquakes</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="s3h1">Cascadia Subduction Zone</h3>
    <p>The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) "megathrust" fault is a 1,000 km long dipping fault that stretches from
        Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino California. It separates the Juan de Fuca and North America plates.
        The New Juan de Fuca plate is created offshore along the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The Juan de Fuca plate moves
        toward, and eventually is shoved beneath, the continent (North American plate).</p>

    <p class="sr-only">Crustal earthquakes have occurred in Washington in 900 AD and 1872. Deep earthquakes have
        occurred in the area in 1949, 1965, and 2001. A subduction zone earthquake occurred in 1700. The subduction zone
        affects Western Washington, Oregon, and California, creates a maximum M9 earthquake, and recurs every 500-600
        years. The deep Juan de Fuca plate affects Western Washington and Oregon and creates a maximum of M7+ size
        quakes that occur every 30-50 years. Crustal faults affect Washington, Oregon, and California and create M7+
        size quakes that recur in hundreds of years, more or less.</p>
    <p>At depths shallower than 30 km or so, the CSZ is locked by friction while strain slowly builds up as the
        subduction forces act, until the fault's frictional strength is exceeded and the rocks slip past each other
        along the fault in a "megathrust" earthquake. The fault's frictional properties change with depth, such that
        immediately below the locked part is a strip (the "Transition Zone") that slides in "<a
            href="https://pnsn.org/tremor/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow slip events</a>" that slip a few
        cm every dozen months or so. This relieves the plate boundary stresses there but adds to the stress on the
        locked part of the fault. Below the transition zone, geodetic evidence suggests that the fault slides
        continuously and silently at a long-term plate slip rate. From its surface trace offshore to a depth of possibly
        5 km, all remote from land, observations are few and it remains unknown whether the fault is stuck or slipping
        silently.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Great Subduction Zone earthquakes are the largest earthquakes in the world and are the only source zones that can
        produce earthquakes greater than M8.5. The CSZ has produced magnitude 9.0 or greater earthquakes in the past,
        and undoubtedly will in the future.</p>
    <p>The last known megathrust earthquake in the northwest was in January 1700, just over 300 years ago. Geological
        evidence indicates that such great earthquakes have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, a
        return interval of 400 to 600 years. To learn more about the history of the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the
        science that led to its discovery, delve into<a

    <p>The CSZ may be unique among the world's subduction zones in that it produces very few (if any) earthquakes
        unambiguously on the plate interface. Coupled with evident occurrence of great megathrust earthquakes, the CSZ
        must be much more strongly locked than other subduction faults. The geological evidence has led to different
        interpretations, moreover, about whether the entire CSZ always ruptures in great M9 earthquakes, or whether
        smaller M8 or M8.5-sized events also can break parts of the zone in between the full rupture events.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The M9 Project, a University of Washington-based research group, has been producing research on Cascadia
        Subduction Zone hazards and effects of large earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest since 2015. For their most

    <h3 id="s3h2">Deep Earthquakes</h3>
    <p>The most common source of damaging earthquakes in Washington and Oregon are deep earthquakes that rupture faults
        within the subducting Juan de Fuca plate - "intraplate" earthquakes. These occur beneath Puget Sound at depths
        from 30 km to 70 km.</p>
    <figure></figure>
    <p>Although plate interface earthquakes can be much larger, and crustal earthquakes can be much closer to our
        cities, damaging deep earthquakes are the most frequent. They have historically occurred about every 30 years.
        The USGS estimates there is an 84% chance of another deep earthquake, of Magnitude 6.5 or greater, striking the
        region sometime in the next 50 years.</p>
    <p>This schematic diagram shows the relative positions of the Juan de Fuca and North American Plates. The "Deep
        earthquakes" arrow points to the depth of the 1949, 1965, and 2001 earthquakes in cross-section. The 1949
        earthquake caused over $100 million in damage, including damage to the Capitol Building in Olympia. The 1965
        earthquake caused over $50 million in damage. In 2001, the Nisqually earthquake near Olympia shook western
        Washington and caused over $500 million worth of damage. Recently there has been growth, development, and
        greater economic activity in the Puget Sound area, increasing the likelihood of costly losses from future
        earthquakes.<br><br>Deep intraplate earthquakes usually are caused by normal faulting, and reliably have very
        few aftershocks. These earthquakes occur where the plate is bending as it plunges beneath North America, and may
        also be associated with mineral changes as the plate encounters increased temperature and pressure. Stresses
        cause faults in the downgoing crustal part of the plate to rupture. While many subduction zones feature deep
        interplate earthquakes extending to depths exceeding 600 km and with different characteristics, Cascadia's
        deepest earthquakes are about 100 km deep. Discover more about the <a

    <h3 id="s3h3">Crustal Faults</h3>
    <p>Shallow earthquakes in Cascadia, with depths no greater than about 35 km, are caused by the rupture of faults
        within the North American Plate. The sizes of earthquakes are related to how big their ruptures are, and the
        biggest crustal faults in our region could produce earthquakes with magnitudes as large as, perhaps, M7.5.
        Crustal earthquakes can and do occur throughout the Pacific Northwest, though they occur more frequently where
        the crust is deforming the fastest. The Puget Sound Region has the highest risk for large crustal earthquakes,
        though evidence has been found for large earthquakes in eastern Washington near Wenatchee, Yakima, and further
        east, near Richland.</p>
    <p>Crustal earthquakes are potentially the most damaging to the urban areas of Puget Sound because several major
        population centers are located near or on top of known crustal faults. This means the seismic wave amplitudes
        will not be "<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=attenuation" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">attenuated</a>" or diminished by long propagation paths between the earthquake source and
        major cities as is the case in Cascadia Subduction and deep intraplate earthquakes. Also, <a

    <p>Seattle, in particular, is threatened by the Seattle Fault, which runs right through Seattle, beneath Centurylink
        Field, west across Bainbridge Island to Hood Canal, and east out past Issaquah roughly following I-90. This
        fault produced a large earthquake that left a geologic record of surface offsets about 1100 years ago. This is
        only one of a series of active large crustal faults in the Puget Lowland. PNSN staff will continue to develop

    <p>Volcanically triggered earthquakes have the potential to cause cracks, ground deformation, and damage to manmade
        structures. They typically are much smaller than earthquakes caused by non-volcanic sources. The largest felt
        volcanic earthquake in the Cascades was a magnitude 5.5 in 1981, under Mount St. Helens. Two types of
        volcanically generated earthquakes are volcano-tectonic (VTs) earthquakes and long-period earthquakes
        (LPs).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Volcanic-tectonic earthquakes (VTs) are, simply put, caused by a slip on a fault near a volcano. Volcanoes are
        often found in areas of crustal weakness and the mass of the volcano itself adds to the regional strain. Most VT
        earthquakes have nothing to do with the magmatic system of the volcano but occur in response to regional strain
        exerted in an area of weak faults. VTs can also be generated from changes in pressure under the volcano caused
        by the injection or removal of magma (molten rock) from the volcanic system. After the withdrawal of magma from
        a system, an empty space is left to be filled. The result is a collapse of surrounding rock to fill the void,
        also creating earthquakes. VT earthquakes can result in land deformation, collapse and/or ground failure but
        they are usually small and leave no trace on the surface. While these earthquakes may cause damage, they usually
        don't due to their small size which produces weak shaking.</p>
    <p>Occasional VTs or even in a significant swarm of dozens of events do not in themselves indicate an impending
        eruption. However, if a significant introduction of new magma from depth occurs in the system, both VTs and
        long-period earthquakes are likely to be generated. <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/" target="_blank"

            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cascade Volcano Observatory </a>use information obtained from earthquake
        activity and patterns in combination with many other data sources from the volcano including near and far field
        deformation, gas emissions, geochemistry, heat transfer, and more, to determine the likelihood of an eruption
        and to estimate how dangerous the eruption is likely to be.</p>

    <p>Volcanically-caused long period earthquakes are produced by vibrations generated by the movement of magma or
        other fluids within the volcano. Pressure within the system increases and the surrounding rock fails, creating
        small earthquakes. In 2004, Mt. St. Helens began dome-building eruptions as magma was thrust upwards accompanied
        by long-period earthquakes. These earthquakes are an indication of magmatic activity and may be a precursor to
        an eruption. When these earthquakes occur continuously the result is volcanic or harmonic tremor. Mount St.
        Helens exhibited these long-period earthquakes months in advance of the 1980 eruption.</p>
    <p>The volcanic tremor can be used to warn of an impending eruption allowing people living near the volcano can to
        be evacuated to safer areas. This method of prediction has been used successfully to predict the eruptions of
        Mount St. Helens in the 1980's and the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines.</p>
