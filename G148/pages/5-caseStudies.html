    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>North American Earthquakes</h3>
    <h4>Basin and Range Earthquakes</h4>
    <p>Earthquakes in the&nbsp;Basin and Range&nbsp;Province,&nbsp;from the Wasatch Fault (Utah) to the Sierra Nevada
        (California), occur primarily in normal faults created by tensional forces. The Wasatch Fault, which defines the
        eastern extent of the Basin and Range province, has been studied as an earthquake hazard for more than 100
        years.</p>
    <h4>New Madrid Earthquakes (1811-1812)</h4>
    <p>Historical accounts of earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone date as far back as 1699 and earthquakes
        continue to be reported in modern times. A sequence of large (M<sub>w</sub> &gt;7) occurred from December 1811
        to February 1812 in the New Madrid area of Missouri. The earthquakes damaged houses in St. Louis, affected the
        stream course of the Mississippi River, and leveled the town of New Madrid. These earthquakes were the result of
        intraplate seismic activity.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Charleston (1886)</h4>
    <p>The 1886 earthquake in Charleston South Carolina was a moment magnitude 7.0, with a Mercalli intensity of X,
        caused significant ground motion, and killed at least 60 people. This intraplate earthquake was likely
        associated with ancient faults created during the breakup of Pangea. The earthquake caused significant
        liquefaction. Scientists estimate the recurrence of destructive earthquakes in this area with an interval of
        approximately 1500 to 1800 years.</p>
    <h4>Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire (1906)</h4>
    <p>On April 18, 1906, a large earthquake, with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.8 and MMI of X, occurred along the
        San Andreas fault near San Francisco California. There were multiple aftershocks followed by devastating fires,
        resulting in about 80% of the city being destroyed. Geologists G.K. Gilbert and Richard L. Humphrey, working
        independently, arrived the day following the earthquake and took measurements and photographs.&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Alaska (1964)</h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The 1964 Alaska earthquake, moment magnitude 9.2, was one of the most powerful
        earthquakes ever recorded. The earthquake originated in a megathrust fault along the Aleutian subduction zone.
        The earthquake caused large areas of land subsidence and uplift, as well as significant mass wasting.</p>
    <h4>Loma Prieta (1989)</h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The Loma Prieta, California, earthquake was created by movement along the San Andreas
        Fault. The moment magnitude 6.9 earthquake was followed by a magnitude 5.2 aftershock. It caused 63 deaths,
        buckled portions of several freeways, and collapsed part of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.</p>

    <h3>Global Earthquakes</h3>
    <p>Many of history’s largest earthquakes occurred in megathrust zones, such as the Cascadia Subduction Zone
        (Washington and Oregon coasts) and Mt. Rainier (Washington).</p>
    <h4>Shaanxi, China (1556)</h4>
    <p>On January 23, 1556, an earthquake of an approximate moment magnitude 8 hit central China, killing approximately
        830,000 people in what is considered the most deadly earthquake in history. The high death toll was attributed
        to the collapse of cave dwellings (<em>Liaodong</em>) built in&nbsp;loess&nbsp;deposits, which are large banks
        of windblown, compacted&nbsp;sediment. Earthquakes in this are region are believed to have a recurrence interval
        of 1000 years.</p>
    <h4>Lisbon, Portugal (1755)</h4>
    <p>On November 1, 1755, an earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude range of 8–9 struck Lisbon, Portugal,
        killing between 10,000 to 17,400 people. The earthquake was followed by a tsunami, which brought the total death
        toll to between 30,000 and 70,000 people.</p>
    <h4>Valdivia, Chile (1960)</h4>
    <p>The May 22, 1960 earthquake was the most powerful earthquake ever measured, with a moment magnitude 9.4–9.6 and
        lasting an estimated 10 minutes. It triggered tsunamis that destroyed houses across the Pacific Ocean in Japan
        and Hawaii and caused vents to erupt on the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle (Chile).</p>

        Ocean, starting from Chile and reaching Indonesia and SE Asia in 25 hours.</p>
    <h4>Tangshan, China (1976)</h4>
    <p>Just before 4 a.m. (Beijing time) on July 28, 1976, a moment magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Tangshan (Hebei
        Province), China, and killed more than 240,000 people. The high death toll is attributed to people still being
        asleep or at home and most buildings being made of unreinforced masonry.</p>
    <h4>Sumatra, Indonesia (2004)</h4>
    <p>On December 26, 2004, slippage of the Sunda megathrust fault generated a moment magnitude 9.0–9.3 earthquake off
        the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. This&nbsp;megathrust&nbsp;fault&nbsp;is created by the
        Australia&nbsp;plate&nbsp;subducting&nbsp;below the Sunda&nbsp;plate&nbsp;in the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;The
        resultant tsunamis created massive waves as tall as 24 m (79 ft) when they reached the shore and killed more
        than an estimated 200,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline.</p>
    <h4>Haiti (2010)</h4>
    <p>The moment magnitude 7 earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010, was followed by many aftershocks of
        magnitude 4.5 or higher. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have died as a result of the earthquake. The
        widespread infrastructure damage and crowded conditions contributed to a cholera outbreak, which is estimated to
        have caused thousands more deaths.</p>
    <h4>Tōhoku, Japan (2011)</h4>
    <p>Because most Japanese buildings are designed to tolerate earthquakes, the moment magnitude 9.0 earthquake on
        March 11, 2011, was not as destructive as the tsunami it created. The tsunami caused more than 15,000 deaths and
        tens of billions of dollars in damage, including the destructive meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
