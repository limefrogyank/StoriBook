        <h3>Why Study Earthquakes?</h3>
        <p>On the morning of June 23, 1946, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Vancouver Island. It caused substantial
            damage to structures, including the school shown in Figure 12.2, and resulting in one fatality. The shaking
            was so violent that the seismograph measuring the earthquake in Victoria was broken a few seconds after the
            earthquake started. Even if the seismograph had survived, it was not sensitive enough to provide
            sufficiently detailed information about local earthquakes, and was unable to record some of them at all.
            There was only one monitoring station in British Columbia, so while it was possible to determine how far
            away the earthquake was from the station, geologists were not able to say in which direction. In 1955,
            Canadian seismologist W. G. Milne wrote that “the 1946 earthquake indicated in a very forceful manner the
            need for better instruments for the study of earthquakes in British Columbia.” A network of improved
            instruments was established as a direct result of the earthquake.</p>

        <p>Time and time again earthquakes have caused massive damage and many, many casualties. Recording earthquakes
            and determining their location of origin is important for establishing what geological conditions are
            responsible for the earthquakes, and understanding the risk they pose. After new, more sensitive instruments
            were installed at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, geologists quickly learned that they
            had underestimated earthquake activity in the area. Between June 1948 and August 1951, 224 local earthquakes
            were recorded!</p>
        <p>By studying earthquakes, geoscientists and engineers are making progress toward learning how to minimize
            earthquake damage, and how to reduce the number of people affected by earthquakes. This knowledge can be
            communicated to governments, so they are aware of what is needed to keep the population safe. It can also be
            communicated to individuals, so they know what to expect and do in the event of an earthquake, and can be
            adequately prepared with emergency supplies.</p>
